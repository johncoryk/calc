<h1>Calc: a simple web calculator</h1>
This project was part of <a href="http://theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>. If you'd like to check out the working version, head over <a href="https://johncoryk.github.io/calc/">here</a>. 

<h2>My process</h2>
This project, like all in The Odin Project, was very tough! Knowing how to link up the buttons, display inputs in the log and set up the grid was sort of easy, as we've learned a lot about these things before. Understanding how to save values to operate on with values that hadn't been put in yet was challenging to say the least.

Like most projects, I took my time studying other's work before getting starting. Debugging tools in Chrome and Firefox are your best friend when it comes to these steps. I'm not ashamed to say that I also loosely followed along with a tutorial during the difficult parts. 

I believe that knowing how to find the answers verus not getting them at all is an extremely valuable skill to have and much of this type of work consists of searching, learning, and replicating. Repeat.

This is the third javascript project in this course and I feel like I'm really starting to get the hang of how HTML, CSS, and Javascript interact. It was fun!
